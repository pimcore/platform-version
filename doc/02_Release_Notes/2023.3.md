# Release 2023.3

Here you will find all the important new features and release notes of the Platform Version 2023.3 release. 

## Most Important New Features

### Select Options
A new core feature that empowers users to effortlessly manage select and multiselect fields within data objects by utilizing predefined select options.
This feature enables you to establish a centralized repository of select options, streamlining their utilization across various definitions, including Class definitions, Field collections, and Object bricks.
Furthermore, these options can be managed and secured according to specific user permissions.

More Details see [Select Options Documentation](https://pimcore.com/docs/platform/Pimcore/Objects/Object_Classes/Data_Types/Select_Options).

### Quantity Value Units - Export/Import
Introduced the ability to export Quantity Value (QV) unit definitions to JSON files, and these files can then be seamlessly imported into other environments. 
This functionality is designed to address the common challenge of repeatedly defining QV units across multiple environments, ultimately optimizing deployment processes for a more efficient and consistent workflow.

There's also a command for importing unit definitions `pimcore:definition:import:units`
