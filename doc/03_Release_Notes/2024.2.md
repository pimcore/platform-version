# Release 2024.2
Here you will find all the important new features and release notes of the Platform Version 2024.2 release.

## Most Important New Features

### Pimcore Copilot enhancements
The Pimcore Platform Version 2024.2 includes the following Copilot enhancements:

- **New automation action: AI Image to Image action - upscale image**
  With the upscale image action, you can increase the size of an image without losing too much quality or generating many 
  artifacts. This action can be executed on a single image or multiple images.

  Use case:
  Upscale images if they are too small for a specific channel to be published.


- **New automation action: Filter data objects based on condition**
  Filter data objects based on a condition that can be defined by the newly introduced Pimcore Query Language (PQL, details see below). 
  The result of this action can be used in subsequent action steps.
  
  Use case:
  Filter all objects with missing multiselect values and automatically assign those values.

- **New automation action: Filter assets based on metadata condition**
  Filter assets based on a metadata condition defined by the newly introduced Pimcore Query Language (PQL, details see below). 
  The result of this action can be used in subsequent steps.
  
  Use case:
  Filter all images with expired usage rights (image metadata) and inform a user/group about the expiration.

- **New interaction action: AI Image to Image action â€“ modify image**
  This action is included in our showcase bundle and enables an editor to modify an existing image using a prompt.

  Use case:
  Change the color of a specific object (e.g., a car) of an existing image by using a prompt.

- **Export, import and clone configurations**
  Easily export, import, and clone configurations to speed up the configuration process or deploy actions to another Pimcore instance.

- **Improved error handling**
  The error handling of Pimcore Copilot has been improved with Platform Version 2024.2 to speed up troubleshooting.

### Core Improvements
In addition to the enhancements made to the Pimcore Copilot, the following core improvements have been implemented:

#### Generic Execution Engine
The job execution engine in the Pimcore Copilot Bundle provides developers with robust capabilities, including:

- Utilizing built-in actions as steps for custom jobs
- Running jobs consecutively or in parallel
- Querying job status during execution
- Implementing custom job steps
- Cancelling running jobs or rerunning existing ones
- Obtaining detailed error information
- Handling both short and long-running jobs
- And many more features

With the extraction of the job execution engine from the Copilot Bundle into the core as a Generic Execution Engine, we 
are making these powerful features accessible to all developers and bundles within the entire Pimcore ecosystem. This 
centralization offers a unified platform to run and track the progress of longer running jobs, asynchronous via API, 
enhancing the efficiency and scalability of your applications. The Generic Execution Engine will also be used in Pimcore 
Studio for longer-running tasks such as batch updates, exports, and similar activities.

More details see [Documentation Generic Execution Engine](https://pimcore.com/docs/platform/Pimcore/Development_Tools_and_Details/Generic_Execution_Engine/).

#### Pimcore Query Language (PQL)
The Pimcore Query Language (PQL) is a generic service that can be used in multiple bundles to filter for Pimcore elements. 
It is based on the Generic Data Index and provides a simple syntax to allow admins and power users to configure conditions 
directly in the UI without security issues.

The first use cases of the Pimcore Query Language will involve defining preconditions for data pool definition in the 
portal engine and filtering objects and assets in the Pimcore Copilot.

More details see [Documentation Pimcore Query Language](https://pimcore.com/docs/platform/Generic_Data_Index/Searching_For_Data_In_Index/Pimcore_Query_Language/)

#### Performance
We implemented various improvements to enhance performance. The most important improvements regarding performance in the 
Platform Version 2024.2 are:

- Making dependencies calculated asynchronously via Messenger
- Calculate delta for relations when saving data objects with relational field-type to prevent deadlocks


#### Handling Date and Time Values in Pimcore

We made handling of date and time values in Pimcore more consistent and fixed numerous bugs.

**Pimcore's date handling now supports two distinct use cases**:
- Point in Time: Dates are formatted according to the user's timezone (e.g., online order timestamps).
- Time Indication: Dates remain consistent regardless of the user's timezone (e.g., event start times).

**Changes and new Features**:
- Object data type `date`:
    - Column type `date` is now the default for newly added attributes
    - Column type `date` is independent of the user timezone (=Time Indication)
- Object data type `datetime`:
    - Column type `datetime` is now the default for newly added attributes
    - User timezone support can be enabled optionally (= Point in Time).
      Deactivated user timezone support (=Time Indication) is possible in combination with `datetime` column type only.

**Bugfixes**:
- Version preview and CSV export now consider user's timezone (in Core Framework as well as in Portal Engine and Enterprise Asset Metadata).
- Filtering for date and date/time values in grid.
