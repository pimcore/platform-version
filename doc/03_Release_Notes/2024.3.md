### Most Important New Features

### Pimcore Copilot enhancements

The Pimcore Platform Version 2024.3 includes the following Copilot enhancements:

**AI training actions**

The Copilot Showcase bundle features a diverse array of action steps designed to assist you in the process of training your own Hugging Face model.
Whether your focus is on text classification or image classification, these step implementations will provide you with the guidance to effectively develop and refine your model to meet your specific needs.

This enhancement includes steps for:

- Start/Stop a specific Hugging Face Space for the training
- Prepare Training data for texts
    - This step creates a csv file of data objects based on a twig template to train the model. In our showcase, we are training the model based on the carClass by using the name, the type, and the color of the car.
- Prepare Training data for assets
    - This step creates a zip file with thumbnails in a defined folder structure. The folder structure reflects the tags of the existing images for training purposes.
- Debug data to send job run context, environment variables, and selected elements to the log
- Start training for assets/texts
- Clean up temporary files

**New automation action: AI text classification**

This action step involves leveraging a pre-trained model to assign attribute values such as select, multi-select, and tags to various data objects, thereby facilitating more nuanced and accurate data categorization. Our ‘AI training actions’ mentioned above will help you train your model to meet your specific needs. Unlike the 'Hugging Face Zero-Shot Text Classification' approach, which is constrained by predefined categories, this method offers a broader and more flexible range of possible results, enabling you to tailor the attribute assignments more precisely to the context and requirements of your data.

**New automation action: AI image classification**

This action involves leveraging a pre-trained model to systematically assign tags to images, allowing for a more detailed and nuanced categorization of visual content. Our ‘AI training actions’ mentioned above will help you train your model to meet your specific needs. In contrast to the 'Hugging Face Zero-Shot Image Classification' method, which is restricted by a fixed set of categories and may have limitations in terms of the diversity of results it can provide, this approach offers a more flexible and expansive range of tagging options. This means you can achieve a higher degree of specificity and relevance in tagging tailored to the unique attributes and contexts of the images you're working with.

**New automation action: Change workflow state**

This action step is designed to provide you with the capability to modify the workflow state of specific elements efficiently, all within a single, streamlined operation. By utilizing this feature, you can swiftly update the status or progression of multiple elements in your workflow simultaneously, ensuring a more cohesive and organized process. This functionality is particularly useful for managing complex workflows where changes need to be applied uniformly across different components, thereby saving time and reducing the potential for errors that might occur with manual updates.

**Improvement: Change the parent of assets**

The action functionality for modifying the parent of a data object has been enhanced to include the ability to also change the parent of associated assets. This expanded capability allows for greater flexibility and control within your data management processes. You can now seamlessly reorganize not only the hierarchical relationships of data objects but also manage the structural placement of assets with the same efficiency.

**PQL result as scope for other actions**

The results generated from filtering actions applied to data objects and assets can now be effortlessly utilized as the scope for executing additional actions. This enhancement streamlines workflows by allowing you to take the filtered outputs and directly leverage them to define the parameters for subsequent operations.

**Add PQL as a precondition**

This enhancement allows you to input detailed and complex filtering criteria directly through PQL (Pimcore Query Language), making it easier to refine and control the scope of the trigger based on specific data attributes or conditions.

**Grouping of action configurations**

Action configurations can now be grouped into folders, similar to other configurations like Data Hub configurations, to provide a better overview in the configuration window.

**Workflow states as a trigger for actions**

The recent enhancement enables you to trigger an action based on changes to the workflow state, providing a more dynamic and responsive approach to workflow management. This improvement allows you to set up automatic actions that are activated whenever there is a transition or update in the workflow’s state, ensuring that specific tasks or notifications are executed in real-time in response to these changes.

**Events as triggers for actions**

The recent improvement enhances the ability to trigger an action based on the occurrence of a specific event, offering a more precise and responsive approach to event-driven processes. This upgrade allows you to configure and automate actions that are initiated automatically when a defined event takes place, providing greater control and flexibility in managing various aspects of your workflow.

**Environment variables in step configuration** 

Environment variables can now be used in action step configurations. This enables the users of an action to easily adjust configuration options when executing an action which leads to even more flexibility for the Pimcore Copilot actions.

With this improvement, you can implement use cases like:

- Enter a PQL query dynamically - and not preconfigure it in the action
- Select model to be used for certain AI tasks
- Select workflow transition to be executed
- Select the ID of a parent for reassigning the parent of data objects or assets
